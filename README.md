## Decisions to Make

+ is the version of ZURB Foundation ok? 
+ should I link to Instapaper articles/list/feed? 
    - if yes, to which ones?  Read? Liked? 
+ is there another responsive/adaptive design template to use? Options are: 
    - cutestrap [Website](https://www.cutestrap.com/) | [Github](https://github.com/cutestrap/cutestrap)
    - bootstrap [Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) | [Bootstrap information resource](http://twitterbootstrap.org/)
    - ZURB [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
+ should there be a CSS framework for printing? See Harjita: [Website](http://www.vcarrer.com/2014_09_01_archive.html) | [Github](https://github.com/vladocar/Hartija---CSS-Print-Framework)
+ should I just modify an existing Tumblr theme?
